\noindent This PNAS template for Supporting Information (SI) may be used to organize your supporting material. The template is intended to provide a clearly organized PDF file that will ensure readers can easily navigate to sections or specific figures and tables. Movie files or large datasets can be presented as separate files. Further information is available in the [PNAS Author Center](https://www.pnas.org/authors/submitting-your-manuscript). 

## Using the template {.unnumbered}

Specify the title, author list, and corresponding authors with the same YAML specification as in the [corresponding PNAS Quarto template](https://github.com/christopherkenny/pnas). The cover page will be automatically generated with the relevant description of the SI.

Figures should be placed on separate pages with legends set immediately below each figure. Table titles should be set immediately above each table. Note that tables extending beyond the width of the page can be included in the PDF or provided as separate dataset files. Oversized/nonstandard page sizes are accepted as part of your SI Appendix file.

References cited in the SI text should be included in a separate reference list at the end of this SI file: @varga2016multilingual and @olsen1992optimal.

Supporting information for Brief Reports is limited to extended methods, essential supporting datasets, and videos (no additional tables or figures). Supporting figures and tables are not allowed for Brief Reports.

## Submitting SI {.unnumbered}

Save your completed SI file as a PDF for submission. Further submission instructions are available [here](https://www.pnas.org/page/authors/submission\#preparation).



## Subhead {.unnumbered}
Type or paste text here. This should be additional explanatory text such as an extended technical description of results, full details of mathematical models, etc.   

# Heading
## Subhead {.unnumbered}
Type or paste text here. You may break this section up into subheads as needed (e.g., one section on "Materials" and one on "Methods").

## Materials {.unnumbered}
Add a materials subsection if you need to.

## Methods {.unnumbered}
Add a methods subsection if you need to.

Figures should be cross-referenced like @fig-frog.
Each figure should be on its own page. 
You can control this by placing a pagebreak shortcode, with `{{< pagebreak >}}`.

This can also be done with LaTeX's `\newpage` command. 
You may find `\FloatBarrier` useful if your figures or tables are running off to the wrong pages.


{{< pagebreak >}}

![Figure](figs/frog.eps){#fig-frog}

\FloatBarrier <!-- always leave a blank line between this and figures --->

{{< pagebreak >}}

\FloatBarrier
<!-- use these FloatBarrier calls to avoid true-to-the-theme jumping ahead of the frog --->

|Species | CBS | CV | G3 |
|:-------|----:|---:|---:|
Acetaldehyde | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
Vinyl alcohol | 9.1 | 9.6 | 13.5 |
Hydroxyethylidene | 50.8 | 51.2 | 54.0 |

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Movies and Datasets {.unnumbered}

If your document relies on movies or datasets, please list them here with their captions.
Use the `movie{your caption}` and `\dataset{file_name.ext}{your caption}` commands to do so.

\movie{Type legend for the movie here.}

\movie{Type legend for the other movie here. Adding longer text to show what happens, to decide on alignment and/or indentations.}

\movie{A third movie, just for kicks.}

\dataset{dataset_one.txt}{Type or paste legend here.}

\dataset{dataset_two.txt}{Type or paste legend here. Adding longer text to show what happens, to decide on alignment and/or indentations for multi-line or paragraph captions.}
